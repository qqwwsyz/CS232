1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?

cmpl $6, -4(&ebp)

2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?
If we delete jmp, the loop will move to L4 directly.
3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle”? Why or why not?
No.
jg means jump if greater.
jle means jump if less or equal.

They have different meanings. 
JYM: it is possible to swap jg with jle as long as you also swap both code blocks with jump targets.
